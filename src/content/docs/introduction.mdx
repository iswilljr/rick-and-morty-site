# Introduction

This documentation will help you get familiar with the resources of the **Rick and Morty API** and show you how to make different queries, so that you can get the most out of it.

## GraphQL

https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/graphql

```graphql
query {
  episodes(page: 1, filter: { name: "Pickle" }) {
    info {
      prev
      next
      count
    }
    results {
      air_date
    }
  }
  location(id: 44) {
    dimension
    residents {
      name
    }
  }
  charactersByIds(ids: [118, 636]) {
    name
  }
}
```

## REST

**Base url:** https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api

The base url contains information about all available API's resources.
All requests are `GET` requests and go over `https`. All responses will return data in `json`.

<Query />

```json
{
  "character": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character",
  "location": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/location",
  "episode": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/episode"
}
```

There are currently three available resources:

- [Character](/docs/character): used to get all the characters.
- [Location](/docs/location): used to get all the locations.
- [Episode](/docs/episode): used to get all the episodes.

## Query Filters

You can also include filters in the URL by including additional query parameters. To start filtering add a `?` followed by the query `<query>=<value>`. If you want to chain several queries in the same call, use `&` followed by the query.

For example, in the [Characters](/docs/character) resource if you want to check how many alive Ricks exist, just add `?name=rick&status=alive` to the URL.

<Query endpoint='/character?name=rick&status=alive' />

```json
{
  "info": {
    "count": 29,
    "pages": 2,
    "next": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character?name=rick&status=alive&page=2",
    "prev": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Rick Sanchez",
      "status": "Alive",
      "species": "Human",
      "type": "",
      "gender": "Male",
      "location": {
        "name": "Citadel of Ricks",
        "url": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/location/3"
      },
      "origin": {
        "name": "Earth (C-137)",
        "url": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/location/1"
      },
      "image": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character/avatar/1.jpeg",
      "episode": [
        "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/episode/1"
        // ...
      ],
      "url": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character/1",
      "created": "2017-11-04T13:48:46.250Z"
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

Check the available parameters and their accepted values for every API resource:

- [Character](/docs/character#filter-characters): name, status, species, type and gender.
- [Location](/docs/location#filter-locations): name, type and dimension.
- [Episode](/docs/episode#filter-episodes): name and episode.

## Info and Pagination

The API will automatically paginate the responses. You will receive up to 20 documents per page.

Each resource contains an `info` object with information about the response.

| Key   | Type         | Description                              |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| count | int          | The length of the response               |
| pages | int          | The amount of pages                      |
| next  | string (url) | Link to the next page (if it exists)     |
| prev  | string (url) | Link to the previous page (if it exists) |

<Query endpoint='/character' />

```json
{
  "info": {
    "count": 826,
    "pages": 42,
    "next": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character?page=2",
    "prev": null
  },
  "results": [
    // ...
  ]
}
```

You can access different pages with the `page` parameter. If you don't specify any page, the first page will be shown. For example, in order to access page 2, add `?page=2` to the end of the URL.

<Query endpoint='/character?page=40' />

```json
{
  "info": {
    "count": 826,
    "pages": 42,
    "next": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character?page=41",
    "prev": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character?page=39"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 781,
      "name": "Rick's Garage",
      "status": "Alive",
      "species": "Robot",
      "type": "Artificial Intelligence",
      "gender": "Female",
      "location": {
        "name": "Earth (Replacement Dimension)",
        "url": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/location/20"
      },
      "origin": {
        "name": "Earth (Replacement Dimension)",
        "url": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/location/20"
      },
      "image": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character/avatar/781.jpeg",
      "episode": ["https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/episode/49"],
      "url": "https://therickandmortyapi.vercel.app/api/character/781",
      "created": "2021-10-25T04:18:48.188Z"
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```
