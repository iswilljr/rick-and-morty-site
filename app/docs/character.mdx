## Filter characters

You can also include filters in the URL by including additional query parameters. To start filtering add a `?` followed by the query `<query>=<value>`. If you want to chain several queries in the same call, use `&` followed by the query.

For example, If you want to check how many alive Ricks exist, just add `?name=rick&status=alive` to the URL.

Available parameters:

- `name`: filter by the given name.
- `status`: filter by the given status (`alive`, `dead` or `unknown`).
- `species`: filter by the given species.
- `type`: filter by the given type.
- `gender`: filter by the given gender (`female`, `male`, `genderless` or `unknown`).

<Query endpoint="/character?name=morty&status=dead" />

```json
{
  "info": {
    "count": 18,
    "pages": 1,
    "next": null,
    "prev": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 43,
      "name": "Big Morty",
      "status": "Dead",
      "species": "Human",
